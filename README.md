#### Prerequisites

Using `rpc-tests` requires installing:
* [`Vegeta`](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta) >= 12.8.4
* [`Python`](https://python.org/) >= 3.10
* [`python3-jsonpatch`] >= 1.32 (see README on integration subfolder)
* [`json-diff`] using npm (see README on integration subfolder)

After installation, make sure `vegeta`, `json-diff` and `json-patch-jsondiff ` commands are available at your shell prompt.

After installation, make sure `python3` and `pip3` commands are available at your shell prompt by running `python3 -h` and `pip3 -h`.
